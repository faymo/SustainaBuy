# Sustain-a-Buy Extension

Sustain-a-Buy is a Chrome extension designed for eco-conscious shoppers. It analyzes product pages (specifically Amazon) to provide sustainability insights, including estimated carbon emissions, a sustainability rating, and suggestions for more eco-friendly alternative products.

## Features

- **Product Analysis:**  
  Scrapes product details from Amazon, including title, material, and mass.

- **Sustainability Scoring:**  
  Uses the Google Generative AI (Gemini) to calculate a sustainability score (0-10) based on product mass and material, along with estimated CO₂ emissions.

- **Alternative Suggestions:**  
  Fetches sustainable alternatives for the viewed product with pricing, estimated carbon emissions, and direct product links.

- **User-Friendly UI:**  
  Displays real-time analysis with a loading animation during data fetching.

## How It Works

1. When visiting an Amazon product page, the extension scrapes the product data and sends it to a background script.  
2. The scraped data is sent to the frontend where:
   - The **ProductAnalysis** component displays the product name, sustainability rating, and additional insights.
   - The **AlternativeSuggestions** component shows alternative products with relevant details.
3. The sustainability score is generated by calling `getSustainabilityScore`, which leverages a custom prompt via the Gemini API.
4. Sustainable alternatives are fetched from Gemini using `getSustainableAlternatives` and then parsed to display valid product links and details.

## Usage

1. Navigate to an Amazon product page.
2. Click the Sustain-a-Buy extension icon in Chrome.
3. The extension will automatically scrape the product details and display:
   Product analysis with sustainability score and estimated CO₂ emissions.
   A list of sustainable alternatives with price, emissions, and a link to view each product.
4. A loading animation is displayed while data is being fetched.
